# Yativo

Welcome to Yativo!

Our documentation will walk you from the basics (authentication, request structure) to using and creating financial products (accounts, cards, payments etc.).

Yativo treats each client as a standalone _organization_. You may log into your Yativo Dashboard to manage your organization's API tokens, users, applications, customers, accounts and more.

Ready to get started? [Reach out to us](https://yativo.com/contact/) to receive immediate access to our Sandbox and start building with Yativo.

The introduction covers basic concepts you should be familiar with in order to make the most out of the platform.
