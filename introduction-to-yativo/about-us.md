# About Us

Yativo is building financial infrastructure enabling over 400M Latin Americans access quality banking services.\
\
Since our founding in 2024, our aim has been to make the digital world an explorable place for Latin American consumers, and for international companies to be able to operate in the region. By providing financial infrastructure in many countries across Latin America, we are changing the narrative and helping more financial institutions to expand their business and offer more services.
